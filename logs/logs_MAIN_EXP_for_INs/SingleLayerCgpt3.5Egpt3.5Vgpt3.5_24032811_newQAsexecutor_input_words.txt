Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above.

The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

query_result[4]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat.

The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

Note: If you have any questions while using the mini program or reading this guide, please directly contact the CPHOS technical group in the WeChat group, we will provide you with relevant help. Note: At present, the system and our official statements recognize "Team Leader" teachers and "Vice Team Leader" teachers; in the past we used the terms "Person in Charge" and "Coach" users, but "Team Leader" and "Vice Team Leader" are more appropriate, so we changed to the naming method.

If discovered, CPHOS may issue warnings, impose bans, etc. Q: Why do I have grading tasks even though I didn't upload any papers? A: This is because the team leader or other deputy team leaders in your team have uploaded papers. You all share these grading tasks.  Here are some questions about identity entry, along with their answers: Q: Why hasn't the teacher's review been approved? A: If the teacher's status is "Pending Review", please wait for the review; if the teacher's status is "Not in the System", it means that you did not log in as required when registering, and the first login is definitely not approved. Q: How to add a deputy leader? A: You need to contact the external liaison, and provide the deputy leader's WeChat nickname, school, and name. The deputy leader teacher must, like you, log in to the mini-program for authorization and wait for our backend review. After the review is complete, the teacher's WeChat can be used to log into the mini-program. Q: How do I add student information?

In special cases, the Vice Team Leader User under the Team Leader User can also help the Team Leader User with marking. Please note, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for this group of users' marking. If CPHOS finds that a "group" of users have quality issues in marking or have not completed marking in time, we will first contact the Team Leader User corresponding to this group of users!

query_result[4]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

query_result[5]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above.
