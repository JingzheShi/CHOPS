query_result[5]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

Note: If you have any questions while using the mini program or reading this guide, please directly contact the CPHOS technical group in the WeChat group, we will provide you with relevant help. Note: At present, the system and our official statements recognize "Team Leader" teachers and "Vice Team Leader" teachers; in the past we used the terms "Person in Charge" and "Coach" users, but "Team Leader" and "Vice Team Leader" are more appropriate, so we changed to the naming method.

If discovered, CPHOS may issue warnings, impose bans, etc. Q: Why do I have grading tasks even though I didn't upload any papers? A: This is because the team leader or other deputy team leaders in your team have uploaded papers. You all share these grading tasks.  Here are some questions about identity entry, along with their answers: Q: Why hasn't the teacher's review been approved? A: If the teacher's status is "Pending Review", please wait for the review; if the teacher's status is "Not in the System", it means that you did not log in as required when registering, and the first login is definitely not approved. Q: How to add a deputy leader? A: You need to contact the external liaison, and provide the deputy leader's WeChat nickname, school, and name. The deputy leader teacher must, like you, log in to the mini-program for authorization and wait for our backend review. After the review is complete, the teacher's WeChat can be used to log into the mini-program. Q: How do I add student information?

In special cases, the Vice Team Leader User under the Team Leader User can also help the Team Leader User with marking. Please note, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for this group of users' marking.

Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

If there are special circumstances, please consult customer service and contact the CPHOS technical team promptly. Q: Why can't I see the student's ranking? A: In the app, you should be able to see your student's regional ranking and overall ranking. CPHOS does not publicly release a comprehensive list. Q: Can the score checking period be extended?

Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

query_result[1]:School Teacher CPHOS Mini Program User Guide This guide is divided into three parts: The first part provides basic information about the CPHOS mini program; it introduces two types of users: ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User), as well as the concept of a "group" user. The second part provides a user guide for the Team Leader for using the marking mini program. The third part provides a user guide for the Vice Team Leader for using the marking mini program. All teachers, please be sure to carefully read the first part of this guide, as well as the parts in sections two and three that correspond to you. Note: If you have any questions while using the mini program or reading this guide, please directly contact the CPHOS technical group in the WeChat group, we will provide you with relevant help. Note: At present, the system and our official statements recognize "Team Leader" teachers and "Vice Team Leader" teachers; in the past we used the terms "Person in Charge" and "Coach" users, but "Team Leader" and "Vice Team Leader" are more appropriate, so we changed to the naming method. In this guide, to accommodate teachers who have participated in previous sessions, when referring to the Team Leader users, we will use the term Team Leader User, and when referring to Vice Team Leader users, we will use the term Vice Team Leader User.  Part One Basic

query_result[2]:and we will open the grading permissions for the deputy team leader. To ensure fairness and the quality of grading, we do not recommend letting students grade papers. If discovered, CPHOS may issue warnings, impose bans, etc. Q: Why do I have grading tasks even though I didn't upload any papers? A: This is because the team leader or other deputy team leaders in your team have uploaded papers. You all share these grading tasks.  Here are some questions about identity entry, along with their answers: Q: Why hasn't the teacher's review been approved? A: If the teacher's status is "Pending Review", please wait for the review; if the teacher's status is "Not in the System", it means that you did not log in as required when registering, and the first login is definitely not approved. Q: How to add a deputy leader? A: You need to contact the external liaison, and provide the deputy leader's WeChat nickname, school, and name. The deputy leader teacher must, like you, log in to the mini-program for authorization and wait for our backend review. After the review is complete, the teacher's WeChat can be used to log into the mini-program. Q: How do I add student information? A: For how to add student information, the mini-program user guide records detailed student addition methods, which you can refer to: 3 Enter student information 3-1 Click "My" -> "Candidate Information" 3-2 Click "Add Candidate

query_result[3]:that schools need to mark, when assigning marking, the number of questions assigned to this "group" of users is approximately 2*8 times the number of test papers uploaded by the Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him. Unless there are special circumstances, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for marking all the questions assigned to this "group" of users. In special cases, the Vice Team Leader User under the Team Leader User can also help the Team Leader User with marking. Please note, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for this group of users' marking. If CPHOS finds that a "group" of users have quality issues in marking or have not completed marking in time, we will first contact the Team Leader User corresponding to this group of users! A school can have multiple Team Leaders. The marking diagram of the Team Leader User and its subordinate Vice Team Leader User is as follows, where "Old Version" can be analogous to the previous version of the mini program, and "New Version" can be analogous to the version of the mini program, which you can use as a reference. Part Two Team Leader User Marking Mini Program User Guide I. Authorization Login and Student Information Entry: 1.

If the scoring standard has multiple methods, choose the method that scores the most for the answerer; if a method not included in the scoring standard is used, and the reasoning is sound, please also report to the organizing committee. For each question, fill in the corrected score in the "Score" column, then click "Next" to transmit the results to the server and get the next question. If you believe there is a misjudgment during the marking process, you can click "Back" to return to the misjudged question, modify the score in the "Score" column, and click "Next" to transmit the results to the server. When the "Unmarked" column is "0" or "-", it means that the marking task assigned to your group of users has been completed. Q: Why do I have so many papers to grade? A: The distribution of papers is fairly allocated according to specific rules. If you feel that the volume of grading is abnormal, please consult the customer service and contact the CPHOS technical group in time. Q: Can I let students help me grade papers? A: In principle, the grading work should be completed by one team leader. If you feel that the volume of grading is too large, you can apply to the technical group,

query_result[5]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams

query_result[6]:function is not supported on the desktop version of the app, and it is recommended to use a mobile phone for export. Q: How do I check my scores? A: Please communicate with the current team leader in your competition area and submit a score checking form. Currently, it is not supported to submit a score checking form within the app. Q: Why can't I see the student's scores? A: There may be a delay in the system, you can try refreshing or wait a bit. If there are special circumstances, please consult customer service and contact the CPHOS technical team promptly. Q: Why can't I see the student's ranking? A: In the app, you should be able to see your student's regional ranking and overall ranking. CPHOS does not publicly release a comprehensive list. Q: Can the score checking period be extended? A: In principle, score checking stops at the end of the designated period. If there are special circumstances, please consult customer service and contact the CPHOS question-setting team promptly.

query_result[1]:School Teacher CPHOS Mini Program User Guide This guide is divided into three parts: The first part provides basic information about the CPHOS mini program; it introduces two types of users: ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User), as well as the concept of a "group" user. The second part provides a user guide for the Team Leader for using the marking mini program. The third part provides a user guide for the Vice Team Leader for using the marking mini program. All teachers, please be sure to carefully read the first part of this guide, as well as the parts in sections two and three that correspond to you. Note: If you have any questions while using the mini program or reading this guide, please directly contact the CPHOS technical group in the WeChat group, we will provide you with relevant help. Note: At present, the system and our official statements recognize "Team Leader" teachers and "Vice Team Leader" teachers; in the past we used the terms "Person in Charge" and "Coach" users, but "Team Leader" and "Vice Team Leader" are more appropriate, so we changed to the naming method. In this guide, to accommodate teachers who have participated in previous sessions, when referring to the Team Leader users, we will use the term Team Leader User, and when referring to Vice Team Leader users, we will use the term Vice Team Leader User.  Part One Basic

query_result[2]:that schools need to mark, when assigning marking, the number of questions assigned to this "group" of users is approximately 2*8 times the number of test papers uploaded by the Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him. Unless there are special circumstances, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for marking all the questions assigned to this "group" of users. In special cases, the Vice Team Leader User under the Team Leader User can also help the Team Leader User with marking. Please note, the Team Leader User needs to be responsible for this group of users' marking. If CPHOS finds that a "group" of users have quality issues in marking or have not completed marking in time, we will first contact the Team Leader User corresponding to this group of users! A school can have multiple Team Leaders. The marking diagram of the Team Leader User and its subordinate Vice Team Leader User is as follows, where "Old Version" can be analogous to the previous version of the mini program, and "New Version" can be analogous to the version of the mini program, which you can use as a reference.

query_result[3]:Information, Two Types of Users, Basic Introduction to "Group" Users Teachers from schools, the tasks of uploading answer sheets, marking, querying results, and exporting student score sheets can and need to be completed in the WeChat mini program. The new version of the mini program allows you to view all the scores and ranking information of your students in this exam (including the rankings within the competition area). Therefore, there will no longer be a competition area leader set up internally by CPHOS. All users need to register before using, and can use it after the background review is passed. Teachers from schools can be set up to use two types of users ( Team Leader User, Vice Team Leader User). The introduction of these two types of users is as follows; by default, all newly reviewed teachers will be set as Team Leader Users. If your school's situation requires setting up Vice Team Leader User, please contact CPHOS via WeChat group chat. A Team Leader User can have zero, one, or several Vice Team Leader Users, but a Vice Team Leader User can only have one Team Leader User above. A Team Leader User and all the Vice Team Leader Users under him are a "group" of users. Team Leader User and Vice Team Leader User can each upload their own students' test papers, and they can also query and export their own students' results. For the joint exams
