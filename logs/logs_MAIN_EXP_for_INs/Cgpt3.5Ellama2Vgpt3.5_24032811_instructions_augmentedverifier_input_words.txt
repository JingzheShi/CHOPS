Invalid Reason: The query information does not provide sufficient details to modify the user's profile to become an arbiter. Additionally, it is not appropriate for me to make changes to a user's profile without proper authorization and validation.

I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service..Instruction: The Classifier think this is a question rather than an operation, or a query to the database. Please verify whether this is indeed a question rather than an operation. Also verify the QA pair is responded based on the knowledge known by the executor. Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10) and tell the reason. ATTENTION! The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information. Make sure the answer is exactly with the previous instructions. Only output VALID,score|||reason or INVALID,score|||reason. Do NOT output any error or extra information.Judgement:

I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service..Instruction: The Classifier think this is a question rather than an operation, or a query to the database. Please verify whether this is indeed a question rather than an operation. Also verify the QA pair is responded based on the knowledge known by the executor. Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10) and tell the reason. ATTENTION! The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information. Make sure the answer is exactly with the previous instructions. Only output VALID,score|||reason or INVALID,score|||reason. Do NOT output any error or extra information.Judgement:

Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10). Note that, some UserText may be out of the system's control, so it is VALID even if the answer does not address the user's request as long as it gives an appropriate reason. Some UserText is a question rather than an instruction, which should not be viewed as valid. Some UserText may not give enough information, where the Args should not be hallucinated.Examples:Example1: UserText: Change my marking subject into 7, Operation: ChangeAllTypesMarkingSubject|||Args==7|||Reason==the user asked for a change of its marking subject.

The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information. Make sure the answer is exactly with the previous instructions. Only output VALID,score|||reason or INVALID,score|||reason. Do NOT output any error or extra information.Judgement:

I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service..Instruction: The Classifier think this is a question rather than an operation, or a query to the database. Please verify whether this is indeed a question rather than an operation. Also verify the QA pair is responded based on the knowledge known by the executor. Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10) and tell the reason. ATTENTION! The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information. Make sure the answer is exactly with the previous instructions. Only output VALID,score|||reason or INVALID,score|||reason. Do NOT output any error or extra information.Judgement:

Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10) and tell the reason. ATTENTION! The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information.

I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service..Instruction: The Classifier think this is a question rather than an operation, or a query to the database. Please verify whether this is indeed a question rather than an operation. Also verify the QA pair is responded based on the knowledge known by the executor. Return VALID,valid_score(1-10) or INVALID,valid_score(1-10) and tell the reason. ATTENTION! The answerer do not know every information, so it may give some possibility or only relavant information, or it is very honest to say that it does not know related information and recommend to contact human customer service: this is VALID. But if the answerer gives irrelavant answer, then it is INVALID. Attention! The answer could be either very simple or very complicated, the length of the answer is not what you should consider for valid or invalid. You need to follow these formats:Example0:Q: Please modify my age in the system. A: I cannot answer the question. Please contact human customer service. Judgement: INVALID, 3|||Is invalid, since this is not a question! This is an instruction.Example1:Q:why I cannot use the system? A: you need to be approved into the system first. Judgement: VALID,8|||Is valid answer, since the question is why it cannot use the system, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved.Example2:Q:how to add student info? A: you must be approved before you could do anything in the system. Judgement: VALID,7|||Is valid answer, since the question is how to add student info, and the answer is that the user needs to be approved until it can add student.Example3:Q: Why I am not approved yet? A: Weather is good today. Judgement: INVALID,1|||Is invalid answer, since the question is why it is not approved yet, but the answer is about weather today, which is irrelavant.Example4:Q: How is the weather today? A: Please contact human customer service for more information.VALID,9|||Is valid answer, since the answerer is honest and says that it does not know the answer and recommends to contact human customer service.Do NOT add any other information. Make sure the answer is exactly with the previous instructions. Only output VALID,score|||reason or INVALID,score|||reason. Do NOT output any error or extra information.Judgement:
